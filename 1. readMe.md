# What's given in the european soccer sqlite database
The sqlite database has a MATCH table that has team Ids of home teams and their opponents (away teams) and their match results. The team Ids act as foreign keys, referencing the team ids (Primary key) in TEAM table that has the team names corresponding to the ids. 

# Aim
The task is to do a inner join so that a new table can be created that has both of the team names instead of Ids.

# Execution
This can be easily done using two INNER JOINS. Through this project I will showcase how to do the same thing with an INNER JOIN clause and a correlated subquery in the SELECT clause.
