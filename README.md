# European-Soccer-Database
The european soccer sqlite database from Kaggle has been used to query out the results. As I have an intermediate knowledge of SQL concepts; switching to an ORM like SQLAlchemy was very smooth. Prior to this, I have used MySQL workbench and SQlite DB browser to apply the core concepts. The best advantage that an ORM like SQLAlchemy provides is:- 
1. The syntax is Pythonic.
2. Syntax and speed of execution is independent of the DBMS used in the background.
3. Each of the SQL systems are stored and executed as objects.
4. The output table can be readily converted to a DataFrame using Pandas and simultaneously visualized using MatPlotlib (I am currently preparing for it). Otherwise, such readily available visualizations can be made by integrating DBMS with a BI tool such as PowerBI or Tableau.
