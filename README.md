# European-Soccer-Database
The european soccer sqlite database from Kaggle has been used to query out the results. As I have an intermediate knowledge of SQL concepts; switching to an ORM like SQLAlchemy was very smooth. Prior to this, I have used MySQL workbench and SQlite DB browser to apply the core concepts. The best advantage that an ORM like SQLAlchemy provides is:- 
** The syntax is Pythonic.
** Syntax and speed of execution is independent of the DBMS used in the background.
** Each of the SQL systems are stored and executed as objects.
** The output table can be readily converted to a DataFrame using Pandas and simultaneously visualized using MatPlotlib (I am currently preparing for it). Otherwise, such readily available visualizations can be made by integrating DBMS with a BI tool such as PowerBI or Tableau (currrently preparing)
